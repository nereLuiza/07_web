        <h1>Previous Hyperfocuses</h1>
        <p>
            On this page, you'll find some of the hyperfocuses 
            I've had throughout my life. Enjoy the journey!
        </p>
        <h2>English</h2>
        <p>
            English was one of my first hyperfixations. 
            I became obssessed with learning the language 
            at 6 or 7 years old, especially because of 
            <i>Maroon 5</i> songs. Since then, I never 
            stopped listening to songs in English.
            Nowadays, I don't study English anymore, 
            but I keep practicing sometimes, just for fun.

        <h2>Monster High<br>Ever After High</h2>
        <img src="/imgs/monster.jpg"/>

        <p>
            At 10 y.o., I found out the Monster High dolls 
            and, after some time, the movies. I loved how detailed 
            the dolls were and the amount of accessories they came with. 
            I had a small collection of them, and I still keep them in a box 
            on the top of my wardrobe, just in case. <br>
            About two years after that, I discovered the Ever After High dolls 
            and series, and they ingressed my passion and became part of the 
            collection.

        <h2>Grammar</h2>
        <p>
            If I have great knowledge about Portuguese Grammar today, 
            it is due to my hyperfocus on it when i was in Elementary 
            School. I loved following the rules and impressing my teachers 
            with no mistakes on my textual productions. Thanks to this, my 
            essays nowadays come with really good grades on grammar.
        </p>
        <h2>Beads</h2>
        <img src="/imgs/beads.jpg"/>
        <p>
            I was so addicted on making accessories with beads that my 
            parents forced me to sell some of them at school. It lasted for 
            about three years. Honestly, I only stopped because IENSA 
            forced me to, but I still enjoy handmaking.
        </p>
        <h2>Drawing</h2>
        <p>
            Completely influenced by my mom, I started drawing, initially 
            just to "waste time". I ended up getting obssessed. I used to 
            see 1h videos teaching how to draw something, and would cry my 
            eyes out if it didn't come out as expected.
        </p>
        <h2>Astronomy</h2>
        <p>
            On the last year of my Elementary School, thanks to physics, 
            I was obssessed with astronomy, space... I used to know a lot 
            about it and (again) watch really long videos with astronomical 
            theories and explanations.
