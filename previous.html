        <h2>1. English</h2>

        <p>
            English was one of my first hyperfixations. 
            I became obssessed with learning the language 
            at 6 or 7 years old, especially because of 
            <i>Maroon 5</i> songs. Since then, I never 
            stopped listening to songs in English.
            Nowadays, I don't study English anymore, 
            but I keep practicing sometimes, just for fun.
