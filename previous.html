        <h2>1. English</h2>

        <p>
            English was one of my first hyperfixations. 
            I became obssessed with learning the language 
            at 6 or 7 years old, especially because of 
            <i>Maroon 5</i> songs. Since then, I never 
            stopped listening to songs in English.
            Nowadays, I don't study English anymore, 
            but I keep practicing sometimes, just for fun.

        <h2>2. Monster High/Ever After High</h2>

        <p>
            At 10 y.o., I found out the Monster High dolls 
            and, after some time, the movies. I loved how detailed 
            the dolls were and the amount of accessories they came with. 
            I had a small collection of them, and I still keep them in a box 
            on the top of my wardrobe, just in case. <br>
            About two years after that, I discovered the Ever After High dolls 
            and series, and they ingressed my passion and became part of the 
            collection.
