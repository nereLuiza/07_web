        <h1>Welcome to my hyperfocus' history page!</h1>
        <p>
            This page aims to tell you about some 
            hyperfocuses I've had (divides into 
            current and previous ones).
        </p>
        <h2>What is hyperfocus??</h2>
        <p>
            Hyperfocus describes the state of being 
            intensely focused on a specific imterest 
            or activity. It can manifest in several 
            ways and it's often characterized by a 
            high level of concentration with a particular 
            subject. Individuals experiencing this may 
            demonstrate extreme dedication to their interest.
        </p>
        <h2>Hyperfocus in autism (me)</h2>
        <p>
            In individuals with autism, the hyperfixation is 
            characterized by highly restricted, fixated 
            interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus. 
            This means they may develop intense passions with 
            specific topic or activities, often surpassing 
            what is considered typical or expected.
