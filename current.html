        <h1>Current Hyperfocuses</h1>
        <p>
            On this page, I'll tell you about the hyperfocuses 
            I currently have.
        </p>
        <h2>Flags</h2>
        <p>
            I know all the 197 flags of the world's countries, 
            and I'm learning the islands' ones. My memory may 
            fail sometimes, but I promise I know them!!
            Consequently, I know all the coutries' names 
            (in English and in Portuguese), but I'm more 
            likely to remember them by looking at the flags.
        </p>
        <h2>Nail Polish</h2>
        <p>
            I have a (sort of) collection of nail polishes. 
            I basically change the color of my nails everyday.
            It all came up as something to make me stop biting 
            my nails, but I can't make it stop right now. I may 
            know almost all the names of some brands.
        </p>
        <h2>Origami</h2>
        <p>
            Honestly, I havent't memorized a lot of origami 
            tutorials. However, I really like following the 
            steps and making flowers, butterflies, etc. <br>
            (as you can see, I like things that envolve rules)
        </p>
        <h2>Books</h2>
        <p>
            Since I was little, I've always enjoyed reading. 
            I have no idea os how many books I have read 
            until now, but I know it is a great number. I 
            like almost all of the literary genres, and I like 
            exploring them to form an opinion.
        </p>
        <h2>Hairstyles</h2>
        <p>
            It doesn't matter if it's on my hair or on anothers', 
            as long as I am making hairstyles, I am happy. I like 
            styling people's hair and my own hair too, it helps me 
            to distract my mind.
